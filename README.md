## choseyourpic.com

This is a website about microcontrollers (pics)

It's divided in three sections:

- Technical: in this section you can look for a specific pic and see its features in a table, or you can search by family. You can do an advance search as well by specifying the features that you need your pic to have and it will show you which microcontrollers match your criteria. 
              This sections contains an iframe to a web hosted in 000webhost since I started the project there but then I realized that 000webhost doesn't support React JS.
              
- Manual: this section allows you to know a little but more about the internal components of a pic in an interactive way.

- Shop: this section contains a basic shoping cart. For the back-end code go to "tlaloc-debug/connectto".
        you can't buy any pic since this is just a project
